Microsoft Word is without doubt the most widely used program to write reports, research articles and books. This means that in proofreading, layout making and editing phases working with Word documents is inevitable. I use InDesign in my semi-professional freelance jobs, so I focus here to that as well.

There are several problems that one can encounter when importing Word documents to publishig software such as InDesign. I assume the biggest issue is usually that the Word document is not actually containing what it seems to contain, so when we import the character and paragraph styles, there is actually lots of stuff that doesn't belong there.
