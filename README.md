Microsoft Word is without doubt the most widely used program to write reports, research articles and books. This means that in proofreading, layout making and editing phases working with Word documents is inevitable. I use InDesign in my semi-professional freelance jobs, so I focus here to that as well.

There are several problems that one can encounter when importing Word documents to publishig software such as InDesign. I assume the biggest issue is usually that the Word document is not actually containing what it seems to contain, so when we import the character and paragraph styles, there is actually lots of stuff that doesn't belong there.

**Note:** In most of the cases these are edits the document author most likely should not do, unless they are profoundly familiar with what is being discussed here.

## What are the problems?

- After import the text is full of overrides
- Some styles are lost in locations that are almost impossible to splot (i.e. cursive disappears in some rare contexts)

## How to prepare the document

- Remove unused styles
- Map the styles explicitly into InDesign styles while doing Place
- Use Word's Styles > Show Style Guides to find parts that are suspect

## Where the problems come from?

- Characters, texts and words are copy-pasted around 
- Actually, I think that's the biggest source of all problemsâ€¦
